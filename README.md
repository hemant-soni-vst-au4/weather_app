# Weather App

> An app that tells the weather. It comes equipped with an auto-complete search bar to find your city!

The `navbar.js` autocomplete interface uses a novel `async` call stacking algorithm to prevent the overlapping of Teleport API responses.

## Future features and improvements

- A better UX and design for the page.
- Instead of a sequential async call stack for `navbar.js`, implement a timeout-based approach as to not overwhelm the Telepor API with requests when typing a city name.
